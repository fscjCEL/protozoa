                        <p>There are several basic motions of bodies. Rotation is the spinning of an object around its axis. Earth rotates once approximately every 24 hours, whereas Jupiter rotates once approximately every 10 hours.</p>
                        <p>At any moment, half of the Earth is illuminated by the Sun, because of the fact that most of our light comes from the Sun. As the Earth rotates from west to east, your location moves from the dark (night) hemisphere into the illuminated (day) hemisphere and back again. The diurnal (daily) motion of the stars, the Sun, and the Moon is a consequence of Earth’s rotation.</p>
                        <p>Another motion is Revolution; that is, one object orbiting a second. Earth revolves around the Sun approximately every 365.24 Earth Days (1 Earth year), and Jupiter revolves around the Sun approximately every 11.86 Earth Years (1 Jovian year). As the Earth revolves or orbits around the Sun, the nighttime side of the Earth (or any other body orbiting the Sun) gradually turns toward different parts of the night sky.</p>

                        <p>The Celestial Sphere is an imaginary sphere on which all the objects in the sky appear when observed from a specific place, which also appears to move. This sphere appears to surround the Earth. The Sun and Moon, as well as the bright planets, also appear on the Celestial Sphere, moving independently from the background of stars.</p>
                        <h3>Directions on Earth, in the Universe</h3>
                        <p>On the Earth we use several directional indicators. We use North, East, South, and West. North is 0o, East is 90o, South is 180o, and West is 270o. We use latitude and longitude. Latitude is an imaginary line that runs north or south from the Earth’s equator, and longitude runs east or west from the Earth’s meridian. We use similar directional and positional indicators for other Solar System bodies.</p><p>There are also Celestial Sphere directions. The North and South Celestial Poles are the points at which the Celestial Sphere appears to turn or rotate. This is an extension of the Earth’s axis; the stars rotate about these points. Astronomers us Celestial Pole shorthand for these locations</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>NCP is North Celestial Pole</p></li>
                            <li><p>SCP is South Celestial Pole</p></li>

                        <p>There are other points on the Celestial Sphere we see when looking up to the sky. The Local Sky is the sky we see from where we stand. It is called local sky because what one would see in Jacksonville, Florida is different than what one would see in Seattle, Washington and what one would see in Brisbane, Australia. </p>
                        <p>The Celestial Equator is a projection of Earth’s equator onto the Celestial Sphere. The Ecliptic is the Sun’s annual path across the Celestial Sphere. Note that the Ecliptic is not the same location as the Celestial Equator due to Earth’s tilt of approximately 23.4°. The Zenith is the point directly overhead. And the Meridian is an imaginary line from due north to the zenith to due south. The Meridian divides the sky into halves and can be considered a division between rising objects – those to the east of the meridian, and setting objects – those to the west of the meridian.</p>
                        <p>Let’s go back to the North, East, South, and West system. Generally speaking, objects rise in the East and set in the West. This depends on the object’s location on the Celestial Sphere and the observer’s location on Earth. For example, if you live at the North or South Poles, the stars will simply circle, neither rising nor setting.</p>

                            <p>The Sun moves along an apparent path on the Celestial Sphere called the Ecliptic. The constellations along Ecliptic – historically 12 but officially 13 – are called the Zodiac. The Moon also travels along the Ecliptic; sometimes in the evening sky, sometimes in the morning, sometimes not visible at all. And the bright planets also travel along the ecliptic.</p>
                            <h3>Measurements along the Celestial Sphere</h3>
                            <p>Astronomers use degrees, minutes, and seconds to measure distances across the sky or sizes. These are referred to as Angular Sizes: the angle the object appears to span or distance between objects, for example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>60 arcseconds = 1 arcminute</p></li>
                                <li><p>60 arcminutes = 1 degree</p></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The Sun and Moon appear to be about &frac12; degree as we see them from Earth. This is not their true size; it is just how they appear to us.</p>
                            <p>&larr;&rarr; &frac12; degree = 30 arcminutes</p>

                        <p>The Seasons are the divisions of a year, which are marked by changes in weather and hours of daylight, and hours of darkness. Seasons occur on a planet or moon because the axis of rotation remains tilted in one direction during its orbit about its star; Earth about the Sun. The tilt is relative to the planet’s or satellite’s orbit. This tilt results in a planet or moon having Seasons. Earth’s axis is tilted about 23 ½o, whereas Uranus’ axis is tilted about 98o. Seasons have nothing to do with the distance to the star; for example Earth to the Sun. The distance to the Sun is often incorrectly given as the reason Earth experiences seasons. In fact, Earth is closest to the Sun in January, not June.</p>
                        <p>Seasonal Terminology include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><strong>Summer Solstice</strong> - Sun’s rays are most direct</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Winter's Solstice</strong> - Sun’s rays are least direct</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Spring or Vernal Equinox</strong> - Equal day and night, going from shorter to longer days</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Fall or Autumnal Equinox</strong> - Equal day and night, going from longer to shorter days</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>At the Equinoxes, the Sun rises due east and sets due west – only at the Equinoxes. An egg will not stand on end because it’s the 1st day of spring (or autumn). At the time of summer solstice the day is longer and the night is shorter. This is extreme at far latitudes and creates what is called the midnight Sun. At the time of winter solstice the day is shorter and the night is longer; E=extreme at far latitudes and results in no Sun during part of the winter season!</p>

                            <h3>Will the Seasons always remain the same?</h3>
                            <p>No, because the orientation of Earth’s axis changes over time. This is called Precession, which is the circular motion of a planet’s tilted axis and similar to a top’s wobble as it slows down. For astronomical bodies, it is a slow process. Earth takes 26,000 years to complete one precession. What are the effects of precession? The effects are the timing of the Seasons and changes in the Celestial poles. Precession is not a perfect path; a wobble in the precessional motion called Nutation causes a small irregularity in the precession.</p>

                            <p>A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth lies directly between the Sun and the Moon, so that Earth’s shadow falls on the Moon. A lunar eclipse can only occur at full Moon. There are three types of lunar eclipses: Penumbral, Partial, and Total. The type of lunar eclipse depends on how far the Moon travels into Earth’s shadow. The entire night side of Earth can see the lunar eclipse. Total lunar eclipses can vary in color and brightness due to Earth’s atmosphere and how deep the Moon passes into Earth’s shadow; Red to Copper to Orange to Black. The colors can be quite varied and spectacular. </p>

                            <p>During a total solar eclipse, the Moon totally blocks all harmful solar light and radiation at totality but not during partial. Totality is the phase of the eclipse at which the Sun is completely covered by the Moon. Right before totality, you might be able to see several stars and planets as the sky begins to darken due to decreasing sunlight. At totality, daytime becomes nighttime; the Moon’s shadow passes over your site and you will see colors around the horizon, called the sunrise/sunset effect. Occasionally you might see bands of black and white running across the ground right before and after totality; these are called shadow bands and are due to Earth’s atmosphere. Animals often react as if it has become nighttime.</p>

                            <p>There are some interesting eclipse stories over the passage of civilization. For example, was Stonehenge a system to predict lunar eclipses or something else? In China, the term for an eclipse is chih, which also means to eat; something was eating the Sun. The ancient Chaldeans believed that an eclipse was a display of the Moon’s anger. The Babylonians determined the eclipse’s “quadrant” – geographical indicator of who would suffer the worst disasters as a result of the eclipse. The Peloponnesian War (5th century BC) was won on the heels of a lunar eclipse; the Athenians failed to retreat and the Syracusians routed them.</p><p>Maybe the most interesting and distressing was the story of Columbus and a total lunar eclipse. Columbus used a total lunar eclipse in 1504 to convince the Jamaican natives to supply him and his crew food – he threatened to keep the Moon dark unless the natives met his demands.</p>

                            <p>In much of the world, it is still common practice to make noise to frighten away whatever is attacking the Sun or Moon. Some peoples are also concerned that diseases are caused by eclipses. Some wells are covered in Japan to prevent celestial poisoning. Some Eskimos turn over utensils to avoid contamination. In India some people lock themselves in their homes to avoid evil rays. And in many parts of the world pregnant women are not allowed outside during an eclipse.</p>
